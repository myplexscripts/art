# Living posters

A complete snapshot of the 32 living posters published at [WAVZ](https://wavz.us), with its original gallery, Canvas 2D scene modules, fullscreen player, frame controls, ambience and music. The original WAVZ artwork, code and audio are by **Nick Saulino**; the gallery retains his attribution.

The existing original **Lantern Cove** page is preserved at [`lantern-cove/index.html`](lantern-cove/index.html).

## Run

No build or dependencies are required. Serve this directory over HTTP so the browser can load JavaScript modules:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Open `http://localhost:8000/`. Open an individual poster using `?scene=beach`, for example. The page also works beneath a path such as `/art/`: navigation, icons and audio are relative to the site. `.nojekyll` supports static GitHub Pages hosting.

## Included posters

| Series | Posters |
| --- | --- |
| Nocturne | Moonpath, Hidden Falls, Lantern Harbor, Campfire Ridge, Night Train, Desert Mesa, Northern Lights |
| Weather | Summer Storm, First Snow, Fog Bank, Autumn Gale, After the Rain |
| Window | Rainy Cafe, Sleeper Car, Cabin Window, City Loft, Sea View |
| Daybreak | Rice Terraces, Lavender Field, Alpine Lake, Balloon Dawn, Savanna Sunrise |
| Deep | Kelp Forest, Coral Garden, The Wreck, Jellyfish Bloom, Open Blue |
| Orbit | Earthrise, Ringed Giant, Space Station, Red Planet, Comet Pass |

All **132 audio files** are included in `live/audio/` (about 553 MB), so playback does not depend on WAVZ's CDN. Audio starts after browser interaction when autoplay restrictions apply. Ambience and music have separate volume and mute controls; available music tracks cycle as in the original.

## Snapshot and refresh

`wavz-source.json` records the original asset URLs, retrieval time, sizes and SHA-256 hashes. `wavz-audio.json` records all audio URLs, sizes and hashes. Scene drawing code is copied as published. Hosting adaptations remove upstream Google Analytics, make URLs relative and use local audio.

To refresh the published snapshot, with Python 3.9+ and Node.js 22+ installed:

```sh
python3 import-wavz.py
python3 import-audio.py
```

The first script follows same-site browser dependencies and reapplies hosting adaptations. The second fetches all audio referenced by the scene catalogue, skips files already downloaded and records files unavailable at the source. Neither changes the preserved Lantern Cove page.
